  description: "+2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.\r\nMedium: As Medium creatures, dwarves
    have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.\r\nDwarf base land speed
    is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium
    or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures,
    whose speed is reduced in such situations).\r\nDarkvision: Dwarves can see in
    the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise
    like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.\r\nStonecunning:
    This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual
    stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when
    built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the
    like. Something that isn\u2019t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts
    as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework
    can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use
    the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit
    depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can
    sense which way is up.\r\nWeapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes
    and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.\r\nStability:
    A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or
    tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or
    otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).\r\n+2 racial bonus on saving throws
    against poison.\r\n+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like
    effects.\r\n+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.\r\n+4
    dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any time a creature
    loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such as when it\u2019s caught
    flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.\r\n+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks
    that are related to stone or metal items.\r\n+2 racial bonus on Craft checks
    that are related to stone or metal.\r"
